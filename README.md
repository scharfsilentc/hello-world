Lapsang souchong is my favorite tea, and I am currently drinking it right now. I ordered a pot in a tea house in Bangkok's Chinatown, without looking at a menu, and felt pleased with myself. Only later, while on Wikipedia, did I discover that in China, lapsang souchong has long been viewed as a favorite of westerners, including Winston Churchill.
